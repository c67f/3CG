Programming Patterns:
-Subclass Sandbox for card effects and data classes
-Game Loop in gameManager
-Update Method in update



Assets:
all images were made by me via LOVE2D's built in graphic functions, with the exception of the card sprites, card back sprite, and button sprite, which were all made by me in Piskel
the font used is Classica, specifically it's "Book" variation (used for the card names and mouseover descriptions) and "Bold" variation (used for everything else). Source is this link: https://www.dafont.com/classica-3.font?l[]=10&l[]=1
