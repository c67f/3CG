There were definitely some rocky parts on this project, but I think it went better than my solitaire project, or rather the revision (Solitaire V2). While I also didn't fully complete the original version of this (the first 3CG assigntment), I did get it 90-95% done with little to no bugs, unlike my Solitaire revision. And as for the revision project (this one), I was able to complete pretty much everything I put in my project plan and end with a fully functional game - the only thing really incomplete is unique sprites for each of the cards, as I only ended up making and including a few of them. Honestly, that's fairly unique among projects i've done for classes so far at UCSC - a lot of my projects I feel like have ended up either feeling incomplete or rushed (or both). This one, I feel like I've done a pretty good job and have a finished product I'm fairly proud of - I especially like how the mouseover card descriptions came out (one of the last features I added). I was worried there'd be some complications, but it turned out to be surprisingly easy to implement. I definitely had to rush a little bit to wrap things up at the end, and I wasn't able to do my stretch goal of adding original cards, but in general I feel like this project was less rushed and more finished tha a lot of my previous ones.
It was also nice to not run into many frustrating bugs - from what I remember, the only bug that really felt like it stumped me for a bit was one with the Nyx card. I eventually asked my dad for help looking it over, and just going over it and explaining it to someone else ended up getting me to figure it out (the problem was that I wasn't adjusting the indices of the cards remaining at the location after a card was discarded).
I definitely would like to at least work on a card game in general again - I really liked thinking about balancing the powers and costs with effects, and it'd be fun to come up with my own card effects.
